# PowerBI Data Project

Welcome to my project where I use Power BI to work with a large dataset, making it clean, organised, and ready for analysis.

## About the Data

I started with a big file of almost 700,000 records in Power BI. To make things work better, I organised the data into five tables using a star schema.

## What I Used

- Power BI

## What I Did

In this project, I did a few key things:

1. **Imported Data:**
   - Took a big file and put it into Power BI to work with.

2. **Made the Data Better:**
   - Created five tables to organise the information for better performance.
   - Connected the tables being aware of crucial relationships to avoid redundancy.

3. **Cleaned Up the Data:**
   - Did some simple cleaning tasks, like splitting names into different parts.
   - Created new columns to help with understanding the data.

4. **Tested for Visualization:**
   - Checked if things were faster and better with the cleaned and organised data.
   - Made some visuals to build a simple dashboard.

## How to Explore

- The 'Original File.pbix' file contains the data before I started working on it.
- The 'Cleaned and Modelled Data.pbix' file contains the cleaned and organised data with the star model.
- Read 'Csv Files Download.txt' to find the link where you can download everything you need to do this project from the original source.
